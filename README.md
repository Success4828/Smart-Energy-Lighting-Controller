Smart Energy Lighting Controller (SELC)
Department of Computer Engineering, Bells University of Technology
Course: ICT 215 - Robotics and Embedded Systems 

1. Project Overview
The Smart Energy Lighting Controller is an automated infrastructure solution designed to optimize municipal power consumption. By integrating a light-sensitive feedback loop, the system ensures that street lights are active only during verified low-visibility periods, effectively eliminating energy waste from manual operation errors.

2. Technical Features
Intelligent Sensing: Utilizes a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) for high-accuracy ambient light monitoring.
Microcontroller Logic: Powered by the ATmega328P (Arduino Uno) for real-time signal processing.
High-Power Switching: Integrated 5V Relay module for safe isolation and control of high-voltage lamp loads.
System Telemetry: Real-time data output via the Arduino Serial Monitor for threshold calibration.

3. Project Deliverables
As required by the ICT 215 Project Handbook, this repository contains:
Source Code: Optimized C++ firmware for the Arduino Uno.
Simulation Files: Verified circuit designs from Proteus and Tinkercad.
Documentation: Detailed schematics and hardware pin-mapping.
PCB Design: Professional layout and routing files.
